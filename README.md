# üåç CountriesApp

iOS application built with Swift and SwiftUI, showcasing a modular and testable architecture with modern async networking, data persistence, and UI state management. This project demonstrates a scalable, MVVM + Coordinator architecture with dependency injection, logging for different purposes, and Core Data integration.

## üß† Architecture Overview

### MVVM

- Clear separation between UI (`View`), business logic (`ViewModel`), and models.
- ViewModels are fully testable and decoupled from Views.
- Reactive UI updates using `@Published` and `@MainActor`.

### Coordinator Pattern

- Coordinators manage all navigation flows.
- Decouples navigation from Views and ViewModels.

### Services & Abstractions

- Networking layer abstracted via `APIServiceProtocol`.
- Injected via `DIManager`, enabling flexible mocking and testing.
- Supports error decoding and retry strategies.

### Custom Logger

- `AppLogger` is a centralized logger built with `os.Logger`.
- Categorized by domain: networking, UI, lifecycle, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Testability

- Protocol-oriented design for all core services.
- Dependencies injected via constructor (ideal for unit testing).
- ViewModel tests cover:
  - Loading states (`idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`)
  - Fetching and filtering countries
  - Favorite management

---

## üíæ Persistence: Core Data

- `CoreDataManager` manages all persistence logic.
- Safely handles save operations and context updates.
- Entities modeled cleanly for long-term scalability.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimizations

- Use of `final` in all applicable classes/structs to avoid dynamic dispatch.
- Safe use of `[weak self]` in closures to avoid retain cycles.
- UI updated exclusively on main thread via `@MainActor`.
- Lightweight views and deferred image loading.
- Async operations managed efficiently with structured concurrency.

---

## üßµ Asynchronous Architecture

- All networking and data flows handled using `async/await`.
- ViewModels update state reactively and predictably.
- No nested callbacks, ensuring code clarity and flow.
